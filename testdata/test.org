#+DESCRIPTION: Just another golang parser for org content!

Have you ever wanted to parse org content with Go? Well now you can!

It doesn't matter if you want to use /an emphasis/, *bold*, =verbatim=, ~code~ or +strikethrough+, they're all supported!

If you're curious what else it supports, you're in luck, you can find it all [[https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous][here (did I mention plain links work?)]]!
